# Why model?
they are a tool to order your thoughts.

"The most common purpose for creating sketches and diagrams were designingx explaining, and understanding, but analyzing requirements was also named often."

Hvorfor modelere med UML?
It is unpractical if everyone is using their own modeling language so having a unified one makes it a lot easier.
"The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate national systems and approach to software design."

When to draw models as diagrams?
- Several people need to understand the structure of a particular part of the design because they are all going to be working on it simultaneously.
- You want team consensus, but two or more people disagree on how a particular element should be designed.
- You want to play with a design idea, and the diagrams can help you think it through.
- You need to explain the structure of some part of the code to someone else or to yourself.
- Itâ€™s close to the end of the project, and your customer has requested them as part of a documentation stream for others.

Models expressing what?
- The problem domain (conceptual model)
- The solution domain (specification/implementation model)
"A conceptual-level diagram does not define source code; nor should it. A specification-level diagram that describes the solution to a problem does not have to look anything like the conceptual-level diagram that describes that problem."
- Robert C. Martin et al. "Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#"
